# Don't know what to cook? :apple: No problem - just take a photo of a fridge! :camera:

## :clipboard: Details

I trained YOLOv5 model on [this](https://blog.roboflow.com/smart-fridge/) dataset to which I have also added about a 100 photos of fridges of my friends and colleagues. Model then detects food based on photo or in real-time and saves listed ingredients. I used [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to get a list of recipes which contain detected ingredients. User is also able to change and delete ingredients or add new ones. Each recipe contains detailed information on how to prepare it. Project is written in Java on Android Studio.
